Amazon Elastic Compute cloud(Amozon EC2)
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud as Amazon EC2 instances.
How Amazon EC2 works 
=======================================================
1. Launch
First, you launch an instance, Begin by selecting a template with basic configurations for your instance.
These configurations include the operating system,applications server, or applications. You also select the instance type, 
which is the specific hardware configuration if your instance.
	As you are preparing to launch an instance, you specify security settings to control the network traffic that can flow into and out of your instance.
Later in this course, we will explore Amazon EC2 security features in greater detail.
=======================================================
2. Connect
Next, connect to the instance. you cancinnext ot the instance in several ways. your programs and applicatios have multiple different methods connect directly 
to instance and exchange data. Users can also connect to the instance by logging in and accessing the computer desktop.
=========================================================
3. Use
After you have connected to the instances, you can begin using it. You can run command to install software, add storage, copy and organize files, and more.
===============================================================
Multi-tenancy
EC2 runs on top of physical host machines managed by AWS using virtualization technology.
When you spin up an EC2 instance, you aren't necessarily taking an entire host to yourself. Instead, you are sharing the host with multiple other instances,
otherwise known as virtual machines, and a hypervisor running on the host machine is responsible for sharing 
the undelying physical resources between the virtual machines.
=================================================================
General purpose instances provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources. you can use them for a variety of workloads, such as:
---> Application servers
---> Gaming servers
---> Backend servers for enterprise applications
---> Small and medium databases
===================================================================
Compute optimized instances are ideal for compute-bound applications that benefit from high-performance processors. Like general purpose instances 




=========================================================
Memory optimized instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large datasets in memory. In computing, memory is a temporary
storage area, It holds all the data and instructions that a sentral processinng unit(CPU) needs to be able to complete actions. 
Before a computer program or application is able to run, it is loaded from storage into memory. This preloading process gives the CPU direct access to the
computer program.
================================================================
Accelerated computing instances use hardware accelerators, or coprocessors,
to perform some functions more efficiently than is possible in software runnig on CPU.
Examples of these functions include floating-point number calculations, graphics processing, and data pattern matching.
===================================================================
Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets om local storage.
examples of workloads suitable for storage optimized instances include distributed file systems, data warehousing applications, 
and high-frequency online transaction  processing(OLTP) systems.
=====================================================================
On-demand Instances are ideal for short-term, irregular workloads that cannot be interrupted. No upfront costs or minimum contracts apply.
The instances run continously until you stop them, and you pay for only the compute time use.
====================================================================
reserved Instances are a billing discount applied to the use of On-demand Istances in your account,
and these are suited for steady-state workloads or ones with predictable usage. You can purchase standard reserved and convertible reserved instances for
a 1-yeaar or 3-year term, and scheduled reserved instances for a 1-year term.
you realize greater cost savings with the 3-year option.
========================================================================
Spot Instances are ideal for workloads with flexible start and end times, or that can withstand interruptions.
they allow you to request spare Amazon EC2 computing capacity for up to 90% off of the On-demand price.
The catch here is that AWS can reclaim the instance at any time they need it, giving you a two minute warning to finish up work and save state.
You can always resume later if needed. So when choosing spot instances, make sure your workloads can tolerate being interrupted. A good example of
those are batch worloads.
=================================================================================
Dedicated Hosts are physical servers with Amazon EC2 instance capacity that is fully dedicated to your use.
These are usually for meeting certain compliance requirements and nobody else will share tenancy of that host.
=====================================================================================
amazon EC2 Auto Scaling enables you to automatically add or remove Amazon EC2 instances in response to changing application demand.
By automatically scaling your istances in and out as needed, you are able to maintain a greater sense of application availability.
Within Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, you can use two approaches: dynamic scaling and predictive scaling.
--> Dynamic scaling responds to changing demand.
--> Predictive scaling automatically schedules the right number of Amazon EC2 instances based on predicted demand.

Elastic Load Balancing
Elastic Load Balancing(ELB) is the AWS



==========================================================22/02/2023=========================================
VPC
A networking service  that you can use to establish boundaries around your AWS resources is Amazon Virtual Private Cloud(Amazon VPC).
A VPC, or virtual private cloud, is essentially your own private nerwork in AWS. A VPC allows you to define your private IP range for your AWS resources,
and you place things like
EC2 instances and ELBs inside of your VPC. Amazon VPC enables you to provision an isolated section of the AWS Cloud.
In this isolated section, you can launch resources in a virtual network that you define. 
These resources can be public facing so they have access to the internet, or private with no interenet access, usually for backend services like databases
or
application servers.
Within a virtual private cloud(VPC), you can organize your resources into subnets.
A subnet is a section of a VPC that can contain resources such as Amazon EC2 instances.
Subnets are chunks of IP addresses in your VPC that allow you to group resources together
within a virtual private private cloud (vpc),you can organize your resources into subnets.
A subnet is a section of a vpc that can contain resources such as amazon EC2 instances .
subnets are chunks of ip addresses in your vpc that allow you to group resources together.

AWS Direct connect is a service that enables you to establish a dedicated private connection between your data centre and a vpc.

A subnet is a section of a vpc in which you can group resources based on security or operational needs
